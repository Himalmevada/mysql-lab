    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** KNN's prediction time increases linearly with the size of the training data. Calculating distances for each prediction can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to High-Dimensional Spaces (Curse of Dimensionality):**\n",

    "3. **Need for Feature Scaling:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** KNN is sensitive to the scale and magnitude of features, impacting distance calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Imbalanced Data and Local Decision Boundaries:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** KNN may not perform well on imbalanced datasets or datasets with complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "   - **Solution:** Address class imbalance through resampling techniques or use of weighted KNN. For complex boundaries, ensemble methods or combining KNN with other models might be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Memory Intensive for Prediction:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** KNN requires storing the entire training dataset for prediction, making it memory-intensive.\n",
    "   - **Solution:** Explore approximate nearest neighbor techniques or consider reducing the dataset's size through sampling or feature selection without losing critical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Impact of Irrelevant Features:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Irrelevant features can negatively impact KNN's performance by introducing noise.\n",

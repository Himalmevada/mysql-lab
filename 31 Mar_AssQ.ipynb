    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting websites and web applications. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Web Hosting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical Servers**:\n",
    "   - In traditional hosting, websites are hosted on physical servers located in data centers or server rooms.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Fixed Resources**:\n",
    "   - Resources such as CPU, memory, and storage are allocated based on the hosting plan. You typically pay for a specific amount of resources regardless of usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Scaling resources is often limited and may require manual intervention. Upgrading hardware or changing hosting plans can be time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Downtime Risk**:\n",
    "   - Traditional hosting can be susceptible to downtime due to hardware failures. Redundancy is limited to failover systems, which may not be instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Maintenance Responsibility**:\n",
    "   - Server maintenance, software updates, security patches, and backups are typically the responsibility of the hosting provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pricing Structure**:\n",
    "   - Pricing is often fixed, with recurring monthly or yearly fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Hosting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtual Servers**:\n",
    "   - Cloud hosting relies on virtual servers, which are instances running on a cloud infrastructure with shared physical hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **On-Demand Resources**:\n",
    "   - Cloud resources are elastic and can be provisioned on-demand. You pay for what you use, making it cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Cloud hosting offers easy scalability. Resources can be added or removed as needed, providing flexibility for traffic spikes and growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Availability**:\n",
    "   - Cloud providers offer high availability through redundancy. Data and applications are distributed across multiple servers and data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Self-Service Management**:\n",
    "   - Cloud users have more control over their environment. They can manage and configure servers, deploy applications, and perform updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**:\n",
    "   - Cloud hosting often follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where you are billed based on actual resource consumption."

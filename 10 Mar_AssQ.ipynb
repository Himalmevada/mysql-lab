    "#### Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating an unknown population parameter based on a sample statistic. In other words, it is a method of using data from a sample to make inferences about an unknown population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are two types of estimates: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point estimate involves using a single value to estimate an unknown population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, and the sample proportion is a point estimate of the population proportion. Point estimates are useful when a single value is required to make a decision or draw a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval estimate involves using a range of values to estimate an unknown population parameter. For example, a confidence interval is an interval estimate of a population parameter that provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to lie. Interval estimates are useful when a range of values is required to make a decision or draw a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval estimates are generally more informative than point estimates because they provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter, which gives a better understanding of the uncertainty involved in the estimation process.\n"

    " \n",
    "#### Automation: with APIs, computers rather than people can manage the work. Through APIs, agencies can update work flows to make them quicker and more productive.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Application: because APIs can access the app components, the delivery of services and information is more flexible.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### More scope: with an API an application layer can be created which can be used to distribute information and services to new audiences which can be personalized to create custom user experiences.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### New data available: an API allows all of the information generated at the government level to be available to every citizen, not just a select few.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Efficiency: when access is provided to an API, the content generated can be published automatically and is available for every channel. It allows it to be shared and distributed more easily."

    "#### There is a lot of conveniences and advantages to APIs, but business leaders should also be aware of the disadvantages. As a single point of entry, an API is a gateway and can become a hacker's primary target. Once the API is compromised, all other applications and systems become vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nine of the top ten vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 now mention APIs — and since APIs can be accessed over the internet, they will have all the same disadvantages as any other Internet-based resource.  APIs are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, CSRF attacks, XSS attacks, SQL injection, and DDoS attacks."
